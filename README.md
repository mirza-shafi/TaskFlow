## Features

### Core Functionality
- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.
- **CRUD for Tasks:** Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for tasks.
- **Kanban Board:** A three-column board ("To Do", "In Progress", "Done") to visually manage task workflow.
- **Drag & Drop:** Smoothly move tasks between columns to update their status.
- **Detailed Tasks:** Each task can include a title, description, priority level (High, Medium, Low), and a due date.
- **Sorting:** Easily sort tasks within columns by Creation Date, Due Date, or Priority.

### UI & UX
- **Fully Responsive:** The design seamlessly transforms from a three-column desktop view to a single-column, tab-bar-driven experience on mobile.
- **Modern Design:** A clean, professional interface with a consistent look and feel across all pages.
- **Interactive Modals:** All user actions (add, edit, delete confirmation) are handled through sleek, modern modal windows.
- **Professional Components:** Includes a user profile menu with an avatar and dropdown.
- **User Feedback:** Hover effects and other small details provide a responsive and engaging user experience.

### Backend & Security
- **Secure API:** The backend API is protected, ensuring users can only access and manage their own tasks.
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are never stored in plain text, using `bcryptjs` for secure hashing.
- **CORS Configuration:** The server is configured to only accept requests from the deployed frontend application for enhanced security.
